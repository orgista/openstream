# OpenStream — owner to-do list

Every piece of feedback the owner gives goes here the moment it arrives, as a checkbox, before any
work starts. Ticked only when it is merged into main **and** installed on the devices; the commit
goes on the line. A request that has been asked for before is marked **(asked again)** so it is
never dropped a second time. Detail and evidence stay in `FEEDBACK.md`; this file is the list.

## Open

- [ ] **Refresh spinner too big / poor UX** (2026-09-26, Mac screenshot): the refresh button next to
      Search turns into a large spinner while Discover reloads.

## Waiting on an owner decision

- [ ] **YouTube attribution.** The trailer frame CSS (N49) hides YouTube's title, channel and link;
      the fast iPhone/iPad trailer start (a130f96) relies on it. YouTube's API terms may require
      showing it. Keep it, or go back to the fixed wait on iPhone/iPad?
- [ ] **Trailers with the title burned in.** Some trailers open on their own title card, so on the Mac
      hero a faint second wordmark shows behind ours (N57). Keep those trailers, or skip them?
- [ ] **Apple TV row headers** are 76 pt, about twice the Apple TV app's 38 pt. Shrink to match?
- [ ] **"Remove the gradient"** — the screenshot was lost (2026-09-25). Which gradient? Retake it.
- [ ] **iPhone tab bar shrinking on scroll** — allow it (the system behaviour), or keep it fixed?
- [ ] **Receipt check (N39 F1).** The app tells TestFlight builds apart (to turn tracing on) with
      Apple's deprecated receipt URL, the last build warning. Its replacement is async and can put an
      App Store sign-in prompt on the Mac. Keep the deprecated check (recommended), or switch?
- [ ] **ServerPlus 3090:** reboot + power limit (`nvidia-smi -pl 250-280`) and check the riser/power
      cable. The free local model workers are down until then.

## Done

- [x] Crash report pasted 2026-09-26: **PosterBoard** (Apple's own screensaver process) in the Apple
      TV simulator, 01:09. Not OpenStream; it crashed inside Apple's framework while loading screensaver
      posters. No app change.
- [x] Narrow Mac windows: no decision needed any more. Since N62 the trailer covers the hero at
      every width; checked 2026-09-26 at 900 and 1100 pt wide on main ab12598, no black strip.
- [x] **Remove the "New Episode" pill** (asked several times) — gone from every hero (iPhone,
      iPad, Mac, Apple TV) and from the title pages ("New Season" / "New Episode Every …" too) —
      c9010e7, installed 08:45; Apple TV Dark Matter hero checked without it.
- [x] Discover row order is a setting (Settings → Discover Rows); Featured Movies / Shows can move
      above Your Library — 74a479e (N67).
- [x] If a streaming service (e.g. TorBox) is down, fall back to the next best one — 74a479e (N68).
- [x] Mac trailer no longer letterboxed in the hero — e92c9eb (N62).
- [x] Wordmark first; the text title only if the wordmark fails for 5 s (no swap/shift) — e92c9eb,
      7c6328d, 1ba00a9 (N62–N64).
- [x] Clicking a trailer on the Mac title page plays it; the trailer autoplays there — 28f7fb7,
      d3e116a, d513f8e (N69–N70).
- [x] Trailers reveal fast on iPhone/iPad — a130f96 (N75).
- [x] Apple TV white-on-white dialogs (Discover Rows, SharePlay source, Download Options) readable;
      destructive rows red — a2381dc, e60e277, 02d3e0e, abd9754 (N71–N74).
