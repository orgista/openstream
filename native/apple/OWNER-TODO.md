# OpenStream — owner to-do list

Every piece of feedback the owner gives goes here the moment it arrives, as a checkbox, before any
work starts. Ticked only when it is merged into main **and** installed on the devices; the commit
goes on the line. A request that has been asked for before is marked **(asked again)** so it is
never dropped a second time. Detail and evidence stay in `FEEDBACK.md`; this file is the list.

## Open

- [ ] **Remove the "New Episode" pill** (asked several times; 2026-09-26). Gone from the
      iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV heroes and from the title pages ("New Episode Every Wednesday"
      / "New Season" too). Merging now.

## Waiting on an owner decision

- [ ] **YouTube attribution.** The trailer frame CSS (N49) hides YouTube's title, channel and link;
      the fast iPhone/iPad trailer start (a130f96) relies on it. YouTube's API terms may require
      showing it. Keep it, or go back to the fixed wait on iPhone/iPad?
- [ ] Trailer with its title burned into the video: keep, or skip those trailers?
- [ ] Apple TV row header size.
- [ ] Mac narrow-window strip.
- [ ] Search: show the add-on's name on results?

## Done

- [x] Discover row order is a setting (Settings → Discover Rows); Featured Movies / Shows can move
      above Your Library — 74a479e (N67).
- [x] If a streaming service (e.g. TorBox) is down, fall back to the next best one — 74a479e (N68).
- [x] Mac trailer no longer letterboxed in the hero — e92c9eb (N62).
- [x] Wordmark first; the text title only if the wordmark fails for 5 s (no swap/shift) — e92c9eb,
      7c6328d, 1ba00a9 (N62–N64).
- [x] Clicking a trailer on the Mac title page plays it; the trailer autoplays there — 28f7fb7,
      d3e116a, d513f8e (N69–N70).
- [x] Trailers reveal fast on iPhone/iPad — a130f96 (N75).

      destructive rows red — a2381dc, e60e277, 02d3e0e, abd9754 (N71–N74).
